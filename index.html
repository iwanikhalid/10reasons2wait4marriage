    <h1>10 Reasons to Wait for Marriage</h1>
    <h2>Inspired by Avril Lavigne's "Don't Tell Me" and Blink-182's "Don't Tell Me That It's Over"</h2>

    <div class="point">
        <strong>1. Trust is Fragile in Premature Relationships</strong>
        <p class="lyrics">"Guys are so hard to trust." – Avril Lavigne</p>
        <p>Trust is one of the hardest things to build and the easiest to lose. In casual relationships, trust issues often arise due to lack of maturity or commitment. Waiting for marriage means entering a relationship with someone who has proven their loyalty and readiness to commit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="point">
        <strong>2. Avoid Emotional Distress</strong>
        <p class="lyrics">"Can't leave my room, can't breathe since she left me." – Blink-182</p>
        <p>Early relationships often leave people emotionally vulnerable and distressed after breakups. Protect your heart by waiting for a stable and committed relationship in marriage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="point">
        <strong>3. Don’t Compromise Your Values</strong>
        <p class="lyrics">"Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl? The one who gives it all away?" – Avril Lavigne</p>
        <p>Premature relationships often pressure people into compromising their values. Marriage allows for a bond built on mutual respect, where values are upheld and honored.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="point">
        <strong>4. Casual Relationships Lead to Guilt and Regret</strong>
        <p class="lyrics">"This guilt trip that you put me on won’t mess me up, I’ve done no wrong." – Avril Lavigne</p>
        <p>Many casual relationships come with emotional manipulation or guilt-tripping, leading to regret. Waiting for a serious, committed relationship eliminates such negative emotions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="point">
        <strong>5. Temporary Connections Bring False Promises</strong>
        <p class="lyrics">"Most girls most do mean trouble, because they are rarely honest." – Blink-182</p>
        <p>Casual relationships are often filled with unrealistic expectations or false promises. In marriage, honesty and trust are the foundation of the relationship.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="point">
        <strong>6. Physical Attraction is Not a Lasting Foundation</strong>
        <p class="lyrics">"Don’t think that your charm and the fact that your arm is now around my neck will get you in my pants." – Avril Lavigne</p>
        <p>Relationships based solely on physical attraction rarely last. True love is built on shared values, commitment, and emotional connection—qualities nurtured in marriage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="point">
        <strong>7. Premature Relationships Can Distract You</strong>
        <p class="lyrics">"Screw with my head, never cave till they get their way." – Blink-182</p>
        <p>Premature relationships can cause confusion and distract you from your goals, such as education, personal growth, or spiritual development. Marriage comes at the right time when priorities are aligned.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="point">
        <strong>8. Emotional Manipulation Hurts Both Parties</strong>
        <p class="lyrics">"I’m gonna ask you to stop, thought I liked you a lot, but I’m really upset." – Avril Lavigne</p>
        <p>Manipulation and emotional games often occur in immature relationships. Marriage fosters a mature and nurturing environment where such games have no place.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="point">
        <strong>9. Avoid Cycles of Breakups and Heartache</strong>
        <p class="lyrics">"Don’t tell me that it’s over, I’m not used to this temptation." – Blink-182</p>
        <p>Casual relationships often end in repeated cycles of heartbreak and reconciliation. Marriage, rooted in commitment, is meant to be a lifelong partnership, avoiding these cycles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="point">
        <strong>10. Save Intimacy for the Right Person</strong>
        <p class="lyrics">"Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you this time?" – Avril Lavigne</p>
        <p>Intimacy is sacred and should be reserved for someone who is truly committed to you. Marriage provides a safe and respectful environment for such connections to flourish.</p>
